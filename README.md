# CleavageEnergy-ML
Benchmarking MLIPs for cleavage energy prediction using a DFT-calculated dataset. Fine-tuning and transfer learning adapt pre-trained models, embedding physics principles like symmetry invariance and energy extensivity. Demonstrates how scientific principles enhance ML accuracy, generalization, and interpretability.
